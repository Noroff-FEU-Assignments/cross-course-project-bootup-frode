        <h3>My advise.</h3>
        I would start with making sure that the client has a secure and well-known web host for its website using https.
        Then I would click through the page (and perhaps also look at some of the code) to see if I can find some obvious security risks.
        It would also be useful to run the clients page through the website scanner that was mentioned in the Web Security module in this course.
        <a href="https://pentest-tools.com/website-vulnerability-scanning/website-scanner" target="_blank">Go to the website scanner</a><br><br>

        If the site has a logon process (admin console, webshop etc.) I would check how it authenticates.
        The logon process can be programmed manually, but that often requires some knowledge in back-end programming and IT security aspects.
        At least it would be good to add the Google framework that has the images popping up where you need to click on all that contains a
        specific object.<br><br>

        There are two-factor authentication providers available, such as Okta and OneLogin. Noroff uses OneLogin, and we use Okta in my daily job.
        They both have a cell phone app, in which you need to confirm that it's really you that is logging in.<br><br>

        It is also recommended to make the session time out after a certain time.
        People often forget to hit the logout button after visiting a site that requires login.<br><br>

        Be aware when using cross-site scripts. Using fonts/icons from Google (like here) should be safe,
        or even some JavaScript frameworks. But try to keep most of the resources on your own domain.<br><br>
